===========================================================
This is just a quick read me explaining all the assets
===========================================================

The Backgrounds are a few i found online. You can choose which ones to use and what levels to use them on. 
If you have an image you prefer that you were already using i don't mind swiching them.

In the Music files the Title screen should be on the title screen and the other short music files repeating over the different 
levels.

The sounds are all labelled for their use. If i have forgotten any sounds please email me again and i will reply with it ASAP.
There is also an extra sound clip of a more animated shot sound effect. Just in case you have a preference in the sound design.

The sprite sheet animations are also labeled for their actions. The Ball being idle isn't necessary to add. I just included it
in case you wanted to put it in. 

If there are any issues with anything, don't hesitate to contact me.
